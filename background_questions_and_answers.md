## Group Dynamics & Decision Making

### Core Group Questions

**How many people are in your core group, and what's the age range?**

*Answer:*
2 or 3 married couples, 2 single adults all between 35-41 years old. And 8 children of all ages.



**Who are the primary decision-makers, and how will you handle disagreements?**

*Answer:*
There is no one prime decision maker. We will handle disagreements by majority vote for small
matters, and supermajority for big matters



**What's your timeline for making this decision and purchasing land?**

*Answer:*
We thing land prices will drop in the next year, and interest rates will start dropping in
about 24 months, getting fairly low in 48 months. We would like to buy at the ideal low price.



**Have you discussed legal ownership structure (LLC, partnership, individual ownership)?**

*Answer:*
We have discusses starting an LLC and having people own shares.



### Commitment & Involvement

**Are all members equally committed to living on the land full-time vs. part-time?**

*Answer:*
No one would live full time there initially. One idea would be to get something we can
rent on Air BnB or VRBO to get some cash flow from the property. But we would like it as a backup
plan in case climate change makes our current locations (esp near Washington DC) too hot to live
in, or some other weather disaster, or social unrest, make us need to move.



**What percentage of the group has farming/homesteading experience?**

*Answer:*
None. Some basic gardening and fix-it skills. We all met through the outdoor club and
are used to roughing it.



**Who among you has construction, electrical, plumbing, or other relevant skills?**

*Answer:*
None.



**How will you handle members who might want to exit the arrangement later?**

*Answer:*
If we have an LLC, you would either need others to buy out your shares or find someone
else that the group approves of to buy your shares. We probably need to work more on that.

## Financial Capacity & Investment

### Budget & Resources

**What's your total budget range for land purchase (including any improvements)?**

*Answer:*
It varies a lot by group. We think initially maybe $40k down payment is acheivable. Some could
pay a lot more (maybe $200k)



**Are you planning to finance the purchase or pay cash?**

*Answer:*

finanace


**What's your budget for initial infrastructure (wells, septic, buildings, fencing)?**

*Answer:*
We would do this incrementally over the first few years. 



**How much ongoing investment can the group sustain annually?**

*Answer:*
~$50k



### Income & Sustainability

**Besides Airbnb, what other income streams are you considering?**

*Answer:*
Perhaps letting a neighbor hay or graze the fields, or selling timber if it needs to be cleared.



**Are any group members planning to work remotely from the property?**

*Answer:*
yes, one or two for the summers



**How important is it that the land pays for itself vs. being a net expense?**

*Answer:*
not very. We would be OK if there was no revenue steam. but if there is some, we could
get a nicer property. Maybe one with a nice, large house instead of an empty lot.

## Lifestyle & Values Clarification

### Daily Life Vision

**Describe your ideal day-to-day life on this land in 5 years**

*Answer:*
Lots of big family  meals. Raising our children together. Exploring local hiking trails.
Maybe building a few small outbuildings together. Building a small community together.



**How much time do you want to spend on farming vs. other activities?**

*Answer:*
We do not want to spend a lot of time farming when we are not living there full time.
Probably we would not live there full time until our kids graduate from high school.
Most likely we would go for a week in the spring, do some intensive work. Maybe plant some
low-maintenance row crops. Go for a couple weekends in the summer. Then maybe harvest over a
weekend or two in the fall. It would be hobby farming at best.



**Are you looking for a retreat/vacation property or a primary residence?**

*Answer:*
We would _love_ a huge house that sleeps 20 as a gathering spot. We also have entertained the
idea of getting vacant land and builing a spartan bunkhouse to get us started.



**How important is privacy vs. community integration?**

*Answer:*
We want enough land to support subsistence farming and maybe add cottages for our kids families
in the future. So we are thinking that we need something like 40 acres or more. Which means we would
not be downtown. But we still want to be somewhat close to a "cute" town or villiage with some
character. We would like to have the essentials like a grocery store and ice cream shop within
20 minutes, and a hospital within about 40 minutes.



### Community Integration

**Do you want to be active in local politics and community organizations?**

*Answer:*
Not local politics. We would probably participate in some local interest or hobby groups.



**How important is it to find like-minded neighbors vs. being okay as outsiders?**

*Answer:*
We would want to live in a community that generally shares our values as next generation
hippies with center-left political values.



**Are you comfortable being seen as "city people" or "newcomers"?**

*Answer:*
I dont think we care either way.



**How do you plan to handle potential cultural clashes with locals?**

*Answer:*
By inviting them in to see.

## Self-Sufficiency & Farming Goals

### Food Production Specifics

**What percentage of your food do you realistically want to grow (50%, 80%, 95%)?**

*Answer:*
Maybe 25% realisitically, but it should be possible to grow 100% of our needs if
we really needed to.



**Are you planning vegetarian/vegan or do you want to raise livestock?**

*Answer:*
Mostly vegetarian. We would raise chickens but large mammals would be too much work.



**What's your experience level with food preservation, canning, storage?**

*Answer:*
Some. We all make things like jams, kombucha and saurkraut. 



**How much land do you think you'll need for your farming goals?**

*Answer:*
Maybe 20 acres under tillage and a reasonably sized woodlot for a few small houses,
or one large one.



### Infrastructure & Systems

**Are you planning off-grid or connected to utilities?**

*Answer:*




**What's your comfort level with composting toilets, solar power, wood heat?**

*Answer:*




**How important is high-speed internet access?**

*Answer:*




**Do you want to process your own timber, or buy materials?**

*Answer:*

## Risk Tolerance & Preparedness

### Climate & Environmental Concerns

**Are you primarily planning for gradual climate change or catastrophic events?**

*Answer:*
I think gradual climate change, or a sudden societal upheaval.



**How isolated are you comfortable being during emergencies?**

*Answer:*
medium.



**What natural disasters are you most worried about (floods, storms, wildfires)?**

*Answer:*
Floods particularly. Wildfires are not a huge problem in the norheast.



**Are you planning any specific climate resilience features (solar, generators, root cellar)?**

*Answer:*
We would like to be off-grid. We would have our own well, a large solar array. Yes a root cellar.
We would like to be able to heat with wood. I have the idea of building an earthship style house,
although it is unrealistic given I have no time due to the fact I have small children.



### Social & Political Concerns

**How do you define "right-wing politics" - are you concerned about Trump voters broadly or more extreme groups?**

*Answer:*
I think "gun nuts" describes our biggest concern. 



**Are you looking to avoid rural areas entirely or just certain types of rural communities?**

*Answer:*
Just certain types. We actually like rural areas. But we would want to avoid areas that voted
heavily for trump in 2024



**How important is racial/ethnic diversity in your target area?**

*Answer:*
Not important



**Are you planning any security measures or just relying on being in a "safe" area?**

*Answer:*
Nothing particular.

## Property Requirements & Preferences

### Land Characteristics

**What's your minimum and maximum acreage?**

*Answer:*
minumum: 20
Maximum: 640



**Do you need existing structures or are you planning to build everything?**

*Answer:*
We don't need existing structures. But they would be a time-saver over building our own.
We don't have the skills (or time) to build anything bigger than a one-room cabin. We would
likely contract out any major construction.



**How important is road access vs. willing to have a long private drive?**

*Answer:*
We would want at least a deeded right-of-way to our land. Road access is non-negotiable, but we
don't need road frontage. We would be concerned about having a private bridge over a creek that
could wash out in a flood.



**Do you need multiple building sites or are you planning communal living?**

*Answer:*
We are entertaining both the idea of one large building (easier to maintain) or several medium-sized
cabins (each nuclear family gets their own).



### Location Priorities

**Rank these in order of importance: temperature, land cost, farming potential, accessibility, culture**

*Answer:*
1. Lowest average high summer temperature
2. Land cost
3. farming potential (mediocre farmland is OK, but marginal or rocky land is not)
4. accessibility
5. culture



**Are you willing to compromise on any of your criteria for the right property?**

*Answer:*
Yes, I think we realize we have so many requirements nothing will meet them all. So we are
willing to be flexible. But also we are not in a rush to buy, so we can wait for a "very good"
option to come along.



**How close do you need to be to airports, hospitals, major cities?**

*Answer:*
Definitely reasonable close to a hospital for emergencies. Airport and major cities are not
important. ( I consider that vermont has no major cities - so we do not need to be close to Boston)



**Are you open to areas that might not feel "cute" initially but have potential?**

*Answer:*
yes

## Long-term Vision & Contingencies

### Future Planning

**Where do you see this project in 10-20 years?**

*Answer:*
Maybe about half of us are living there full time. The rest come for a week or two every year
as a get-together. We have mostly still working on the goal in 10 years
(maybe 2/3 of the way there).
 But have acheived it in 20.



**Are you planning to expand the community or keep it at ~20 people?**

*Answer:*
We may add a few, but not double in size.



**How will you handle aging group members who can't contribute as much labor?**

*Answer:*
They will not need to contribute. It will be a "from each according to his ability" situation.



**Are you open to selling if your vision doesn't work out?**

*Answer:*
Yes



### Success Metrics

**How will you measure whether this venture is successful?**

*Answer:*
Amount of time spent at the propety. Percentage of participants who are still active years from now.



**What would cause you to abandon the project?**

*Answer:*
Major financial problems by two or more parties. Committment turns out to be too much.
Costs become unmanagable. 



**Are you prepared for the social challenges of intentional community living?**

*Answer:*
Yes, we backpack together so are used to close quarters.



**How will you maintain group cohesion and resolve conflicts?**

*Answer:*
We have a montesori teacher and diplomat among us who will keep the peace. We are generally
a lot drama group, but I appreciate these things can happen.

Our professions are:
* Montesori teacher
* foreigh policy
* Electric utiliy sustainability engineer

### Healthcare & Family

**Are there children in the group, and how does that affect your planning?**

*Answer:*
Yes, seven children. We want them to be able to still attend their normal school back home.
We know that moving a child to a new school in middle or high school is very distruptive
to their development. But we want our kids to all grow up knowing eachother and spending enough
time with the other adults on the group that they think of them as aunts and uncles.



**How important is access to quality healthcare and specialists?**

*Answer:*
The local hospital can be second-tier. We are young enough we are willing to drive
2-3 hours for a specialist.

*Answer:*
One adult has mild chronic fatigue (CFS/ME).
One child has several food allergies and needs to go to the ER for accidental exposure about once a year.



**How will you handle emergencies when far from urban medical facilities?**

*Answer:*
We are fairly handy with first aid. Some of us have taken wilderness first responder courses.
but the default is still always dial 911.
