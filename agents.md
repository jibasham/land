# Land Comparison Report Compilation Instructions

## Overview
Compile a comprehensive ~20-page report comparing 7 northeastern US regions for land purchase by a group of 8 adults (ages 35-41) with 7 children, focusing on climate resilience, part-time use initially, and eventual backup community for climate change/social disruption.

## Target Regions
1. Northern Vermont
2. Southern Vermont  (i.e., everything that is not Northern Vermont)
3. The Adirondacks (NY)
4. The Catskills (NY)
5. The Berkshires (MA)
6. Northern New Hampshire (White Mountains)
7. Maine (emphasis on northern Maine)

## Group-Specific Context
- **Group Composition**: 2-3 married couples, 2 single adults, 7 children
- **Budget**: ~$40k down payment per family is achievable, some members can contribute $200k+, will finance purchase
- **Timeline**: Not rushed, waiting for optimal land prices (1-4 years), tracking interest rate drops
- **Usage Pattern**: Part-time initially, full-time backup plan, eventual retirement community
- **Land Size**: 20-640 acres minimum
- **Priority Order**: 1) Temperature, 2) Land cost, 3) Farming potential, 4) Accessibility, 5) Culture
